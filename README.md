NGSEP is an integrated framework for analysis of high throughput sequencing (HTS) reads. The main functionality of NGSEP is the variants detector, which allows to make integrated discovery and genotyping of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions, and genomic regions with copy number variation (CNVs).
